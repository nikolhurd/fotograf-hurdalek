# Fotograf Hurdálek - Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio for a photographer, still using placeholder text and images for now.

## Development Process & Learning

I decided to give TypeScript a try even though I didn’t have deep TypeScript experience, so I turned to Gemini to help bootstrap much of the code but I carefully walked through every suggestion, tweaking the code to fit my needs.
